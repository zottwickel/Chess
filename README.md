# Chess
A fully-functional game of chess, complete with save games and unicode chess pieces.

# Setup
This chess app runs best in the terminal with the following font: Monospace Regular (Size:21 (or between 18 and 24)). Otherwise pieces may overlap, or the size will be too small.

To change this in ubuntu terminals open a new terminal and follow the path:
Edit > Profile Preferences > General(tab) > Custom Font(checkbox and selector) > Monospace Regular (with size box 21) > close
...or make a new profile with the font at that size.
